# Inferno-League-Bot
The Inferno League Bot made by 1love 1life forked from Pokemon Showdown bot by TalkTakesTime , Quinella and Morfent

Custom League commands added just to reduce key strokes in League room

To run bot, open cmd and type the commands as follow -

1) cd <directory to bot files> e.g.  C:\Users\SomeName\Desktop\FolderName
2) npm install   // npm install should be done only first time when running bot to install dependencies 
3) node main.js  

After node main.js , the bot will run and will join the room specified in exports.room in config-example.js
